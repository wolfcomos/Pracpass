# Performance Benchmark for EECS 583 HW2

For the bonus part, you can find and hoist as many instructions as possible. You need to determine which instructions will cause the greatest benefit when hoisted. We will evaluate the correctness of your pass first, then the execution time (performance). You can use your own heuristic for defining the frequent path.

Execution times for original (unoptimized) programs (Measured on eecs583a):

hw2perf1.c : ~  7 seconds
hw2perf2.c : ~ 10 seconds
hw2perf3.c : ~ 26 seconds
hw2perf4.c : ~ 29 seconds
